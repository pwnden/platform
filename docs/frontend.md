# Frontend workspace

The browser client lives in `web/`. Go owns the local server, authentication,
problem execution and answer checking. Node and pnpm are build tools.

## Packages and ownership

| Package | Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@pwnden/player` | `web/apps/player` | Session initialization and composition. |
| `@pwnden/ui` | `web/packages/ui` | Own button/input API, Sectile wrappers and theme tokens. |
| `@pwnden/api` | `web/packages/api` | Implement domain ports with the Go HTTP API. |
| `@pwnden/catalog` | `web/domains/catalog` | Problem models and catalog port; pure TypeScript. |
| `@pwnden/play` | `web/domains/play` | Run/submission models and player port; pure TypeScript. |
| `@pwnden/catalog-feature` | `web/features/catalog` | Vue catalog presentation and loading state. |
| `@pwnden/play-feature` | `web/features/play` | Vue execution controls and submission presentation. |

The app injects API implementations into features. Features import their domain
and the UI package. The API package imports domain ports and models. Domains
use ES libraries without browser, framework or transport dependencies. The UI
package alone imports Sectile; its public props and events belong to pwnden.
Progress and terminal packages are introduced with their actual capabilities.

Use public package exports between packages and relative imports inside one
package. `web/tools/boundaries.mjs` keeps the allowlist independently of package
manifests. It checks manifests, static/type imports, re-exports, literal dynamic
imports, import types, Vue scripts/styles, relative paths, source symlinks,
package internals and package/module cycles. Resolution uses public workspace
exports; compiler/Vite aliases and computed module loaders require an explicit
policy change. Domains also reject ambient reference directives. Negative
fixtures exercise these restrictions. This is a development dependency check,
not a sandbox for arbitrary code in build tools.

Project-owned abbreviations use whole lowercase or whole uppercase. The checker
recognizes common abbreviations in source identifiers; third-party names retain
their upstream spelling. Repository guidance records the general convention.

## Pinned build tools

| Tool | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node LTS | `24.21.0` |
| pnpm | `12.8.1` |
| Vue / compiler / renderer | `3.5.43` |
| Vite / Vue plugin | `8.3.1` / `6.0.9` |
| TypeScript native bridge | `6.0.3-bridge.18.tsgo.7.0.2` |
| vue-tsc | `3.3.11` |
| Sectile Vue | `0.18.2` |
| Vitest | `5.0.2` |

`typescript` is an exact npm alias to `typescript-native-bridge`, also overridden
throughout the workspace. Both `tsc` and `vue-tsc` report `TNB ACTIVE` during
checking. Direct, peer and development dependencies use exact versions, and
internal dependencies use `workspace:0.1.0`. `saveExact` is enabled. pnpm 12
records package-manager resolution and application resolution as two YAML
documents in the committed lockfile; use the pinned pnpm to consume it.

## Verification

From the repository root, Docker runs the same checks as frontend CI:

```sh
docker build --file Dockerfile.web --target verify .
```

With the pinned development tools installed:

```sh
cd web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
```

Verification checks boundaries, every package's types, negative dependency
fixtures, HTTP request/response mapping, native button attributes, Sectile input
label/value rendering and a production build. Build output is ignored under
`web/dist/player`. CI builds and tests; it uploads no artifacts.

To export verified static assets locally:

```sh
docker build --file Dockerfile.web --target assets --output type=local,dest=dist/web .
```

## Integration status

The Vue app composes catalog and play features for the four existing HTTP
operations. The API client uses a fixed same-origin `/api/v1` base, keeps the
fragment token in memory and uses a bearer header. It follows the server's
snake_case DTOs and tolerates extra response fields. Flags are checked on Go;
an incorrect answer is an ordinary rejected submission. Requests do not follow
redirects or persist credentials. The app removes the initial token fragment
before rendering and provides recovery text for missing sessions.

Go still serves the placeholder page. Serving these assets from Go and including
them in clone/setup packaging is the next integration step. The app's entry
point consumes the fragment itself; that integration must coordinate it with
Go's existing `/session.js` initializer so the token is consumed once. A
separate Vite server does not provide authenticated access to Go's API: the
server allows its own local origin. Browser execution against Go, container
terminal access, file downloads and persisted player status remain subsequent
verification and implementation stages.
